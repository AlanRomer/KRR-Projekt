The approach for solving this problem can be broken down into 2 Layers outside of visualisation. The First tries to assign all Agents towards an end position while minimizing makespan and secondary sum of cost, this is done by determining the distance of agents to all targets while only following paths given to us at the beginning and select a a new target for every agent which is optimal in makespan and minimizes sum of cost. The Second is for Conflict resolution through the waiting of specific Agents.
